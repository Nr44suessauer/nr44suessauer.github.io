# Octoprint Server for 3D Printers

The project "3D Printer & Server Tuning" combines innovative approaches in embedded systems with practical applications in the field of 3D printing. The goal is to develop a modular and expandable system that allows both students and technology enthusiasts to deepen their knowledge of 3D printing, microcontrollers, and Raspberry Pi. The setup integrates multiple 3D printers, cameras, LED light controls, and a physical input unit. The focus is on playful expandability and support through comprehensive interfaces.

The project includes the repair and tuning of a Taz-3 printer, the development of an illuminated server case, and the implementation of control systems via ArduinoBoards and Raspberry Pi. Through experiments with hardware and software, a robust and versatile system has been created, distinguished by its user-friendly and visually appealing design.

The documentation provides valuable insights into the challenges and solutions in development, including potential expansions such as using Octoprint for multiple printers and cameras, as well as performance tests with compact systems like the Raspberry Pi Zero. This project serves not only as a practical learning tool but also lays the foundation for future smart home applications.

Please note that the video and documentation are in German as they were part of a Bachelor course. Upon request, I am happy to provide more information about projects like this.
