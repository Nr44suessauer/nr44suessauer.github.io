# PlantUML Installation Guide
This guide will help you set up PlantUML on your system, including the necessary prerequisites and configuration steps.

Diagrams are created using the PlantUML tool. The final images are generated from a source file, which must be created beforehand by the documenting developer.

The tool can be downloaded and installed as a [VSCode Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=jebbs.plantuml) (recommended) or via the [PlantUML Website](https://plantuml.com/download). On this website, you will also find information on how to write PlantUML diagrams.

#### Prerequisites

- An installed **JAVA Runtime Environment** listed in the **_environment variables_**.
- The [**PlantUML JAR**](https://plantuml.com/download) file.

For further information on the installation and prerequisites of the VSCode extension, click [here](https://github.com/qjebbs/vscode-plantuml/blob/master/README.md).

#### Java Environment Variables Windows

After **JAVA** has been downloaded and installed from their [website](https://www.java.com/de/download/), the **Path** and **JAVA_HOME** environment variables need to be created or expanded. (On Linux, this should happen automatically during installation.)

On Windows, go to **System Properties -> Advanced System Settings -> Environment Variables**.

##### JAVA_HOME

Create a new entry named **JAVA_HOME** under either user or system variables. In this, the path to the main directory of the installed **Java Runtime Environment** is stored.

For instance, it might look like this:

```
C:\Program files\Java\jre-1.8\
```

##### Path

Either expand the already existing **Path** variable using the **_edit_** field or create it anew if the variable does not exist yet. This variable contains the path to the executable Java file.

For example:

```
C:\Program files\java\jre-1.8\bin\
```

can alternatively be written as:

```
%JAVA_HOME%\bin\
```

---


#### Testing Java Installation


To confirm Java is working and display the installed version:

```bash
java -version
```

This should output something like:
```
java version "1.8.0_XXX"
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_XXX-bXX)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build XX.XXX-bXX, mixed mode)
```

---

#### PlantUML JAR

To use the PlantUML JAR file, download it from their [website](https://plantuml.com/download) (the license can be chosen freely). After downloading, save it in a known location on your file system.

For example:

```
C:\Users\USER\JAR-Files\plantuml.jar
```

This path is important for using the **local renderer** of the VSCode extension for PlantUML. It is also needed if you want to run PlantUML directly using the JAR file.

---

#### PlantUML VSCode Extension Settings

When using PlantUML as a VSCode extension, some adjustments need to be made in the extension settings. After the VSCode extension has been installed, click on Extensions -> PlantUML on the gear icon next to the **_Uninstall_** field and select **Extension Settings**.

**Export Settings**<br/>
Please enter:

under **Diagrams Root**:

```
docs/diagramms/src
```

and under **Export Out Dir**:

```
docs/diagrams/out
```

Additional settings (which should be default) include:

- Export Concurrency: **3**
- Export Include Folder Hierarchy: **true**
- Export Sub Folder: **true**

This should ensure that all necessary subfolders and the **out/** folder itself are correctly created when exporting the diagrams.

**Generation Settings**<br/>
To generate images from the source files and to display a preview of the diagram, the PlantUML JAR and Java must be specified and a render mode selected.

To do this, under **Jar**, specify the path to the downloaded **plantuml.jar** file.

For example:

```
C:\Users\USER\JAR-Files\plantuml.jar
```

##### Important

> Specify the full file path, including file name and extension.

Under **Java**, provide the path to your **Java Executable**,

```
C:\Program files\java\jre-1.8\bin\java
```

or, if environment variables are set correctly, simply

```
java
```

Lastly, under:

- **Render**, select the **Local** option.

---

Finally, VSCode should be restarted once to apply the changes.

### Diagram Structure

In the subfolder **diagrams/**, you'll find the created diagrams in PlantUML format. This is further divided into **src/** and **out/** folders.

The **src/** folder is divided into folders for the respective subprojects and contains the source files of the diagrams, with a **.puml** file extension.

In a **.puml** file, several diagrams can be present, and each file is exported to its own folder in the **out/** directory upon export. This allows a file to be used for several diagrams of a (sub-)system or a component.

For example, a file named **CLI.puml** could be created for a **CLI** in the **docs/diagrams/src/something/** folder. This file could contain both a flow diagram and a component diagram to illustrate the flow of the **CLI** and its constituent components.

When the diagrams from this file are now exported, assuming the settings mentioned above are correct, they can be found in a folder with the path **docs/diagrams/out/something/CLI/**. Consequently, the specified folder would contain an image file for the flow diagram and an image file for the component diagram.
