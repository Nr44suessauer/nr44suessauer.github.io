This document explains the architecture of the project [I-Scan](https://deadlinedriven.dev/projects/I-Scan/). Based on the available API with which the user can interact, the underlying processes and structures are explained. This includes the various HTTP methods used to communicate with the server, as well as the specific commands and their functionality within the system.

## Introduction to REST APIs

REST APIs (Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interfaces) are a set of rules and conventions for building and interacting with web services. They allow different systems to communicate over HTTP by using standard HTTP methods such as `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, and `DELETE`. These methods enable clients to perform various operations on the server, such as retrieving configurations, updating settings, and managing scan processes.

### HTTP Methods

- **GET**: This method is used to retrieve data from the server. It is commonly used to read resources such as files, database entries, or other information. An example would be fetching a list of users.

- **POST**: This method is used to send new data to the server and create a new resource. An example would be creating a new user in a database.

- **PUT**: This method is used to update or replace an existing resource on the server. An example would be updating the information of an existing user.

- **DELETE**: This method is used to delete a resource from the server. An example would be removing a user from a database.

REST APIs are widely used due to their simplicity, scalability, and stateless nature, making them ideal for modern web applications. They provide a flexible and efficient way to exchange data between client and server, enabling the integration of different systems and services.

        The architecture of the <strong>I-Scan</strong> is shown. Through a <strong>REST API</strong>, the user/developer has the opportunity to interact with the various components in this diagram. A <strong>REST API</strong> and a web server are provided for this purpose. Now, the accessible commands are explained, and the processes behind them are discussed.
        The <strong> main system represents the user and has an evaluative function </strong>. Photogrammetry or similar processes will take place on this system. The I-Scan runs autonomously after it has been configured and started. Upon completion of the scan, the main system should retrieve the raw scan data via the REST API.
